## Current Status
**Last Updated**: 2026-07-02
**Last Agent Session**: Fixed Meta catalogue import/publish behavior so products synced from Meta are queued for WhatsApp customer visibility, publish failures are surfaced, and the Catalogue UI now labels the action as `Publish to WhatsApp`.
**Test Suite Status**: PASS - `cd backend && npm test` (29 tests); PASS - backend PowerShell `node --check` sweep; PASS - `cd frontend && npm run lint` (10 warnings, 0 errors); PASS - `cd frontend && npm run build`; PASS - `npm audit --audit-level=high` in both `backend/` and `frontend/`.

## In Progress
- [ ] After this change deploys to `https://broadcast-gilt.vercel.app/`, run Catalogue -> `Sync from Meta` or `Publish to WhatsApp`, confirm the toast reports `failed: 0`, and verify the WhatsApp customer catalogue after Meta processes the batch.
- [ ] Smoke-test live Vercel unknown-message behavior on `https://broadcast-gilt.vercel.app/`: send a nonsense customer text, confirm the bot asks "Sorry, I didn't understand..." with Yes/No buttons, tap No and verify no Needs Human state, then repeat and tap Yes to verify Needs Human appears.
- [ ] Smoke-test live Vercel support feedback on `https://broadcast-gilt.vercel.app/`: resolve a test chat, tap Good/Bad in WhatsApp, and verify the only bot response is "Thank you for your feedback."
- [ ] Smoke-test live Vercel Chat Inbox freshness on `https://broadcast-gilt.vercel.app/`: receive a new WhatsApp message and verify the conversation list/open thread update within about 5 seconds without refreshing.
- [ ] Smoke-test Chat Inbox filters on the live Vercel URL: All, Unread, Paid orders, Unpaid orders, Abandoned carts, Needs human, filter counts, and conversation chips.
- [ ] Smoke-test Chat Inbox handoff state on the live Vercel URL: a `needs_human + bot_paused` conversation should show Needs Human/Resolve Handoff but not the green Resolve Chat button, and resolving should send one feedback request.
- [ ] Confirm Vercel production env vars still include `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`.

## Blocked On
- None for GitHub writes: `shivanshu407` has write access to `naramadaessence/broadcast`; push deployment changes directly to `origin`.
- Vercel/MongoDB setup is manual: the code cannot create the client's Atlas database or set Vercel env vars from this local checkout.

## Decisions Needed
- None for this change.

## Next Steps (for the next agent session)
1. Run `git status --short --branch` and confirm local `main` tracks `origin/main` for `naramadaessence/broadcast`.
2. Check the Vercel deployment status after direct pushes to `main`.
3. Log in on `https://broadcast-gilt.vercel.app/`, run Catalogue -> `Publish to WhatsApp` or `Sync from Meta`, and verify products appear in the WhatsApp customer catalogue after Meta processing.
4. Verify Settings -> Automation & Hours, Knowledge Base, Test Your Bot, Chat Inbox timestamps, Resolve Handoff, teach-from-chat, commerce filters, the single resolve action, support-feedback thank-you, inbox polling refresh, and unknown-message Yes/No handoff confirmation.
5. Rotate/delete the previously exposed Atlas user from the old hardcoded URI if that manual cleanup has not already been completed.

## Do Not Touch
- Do not reintroduce hardcoded MongoDB credentials or point this fork at the original SaaS database.
- Do not restore external AI provider requirements; Smart Automation is local with lexical fallback.
- Do not convert this into a tenant-seat SaaS deployment unless the client requirement changes.
